                    Us friends have varying hobbies and interests and we, as a developers, decided to create an application for everyone. 
                    We want to showcase everyone's arts and crafts, original works, analysis, discussions, and create a community that helps each other foster their hobbies. 
                    With this, we decided to create a hobby site. The goal is to create applications on the site that will show a merchandise store, a wiki, a blog, a forum, and a commission board. 
                    After a bit more work, we decided to expand this site to include user inputs and functionalities to expand our user base.
