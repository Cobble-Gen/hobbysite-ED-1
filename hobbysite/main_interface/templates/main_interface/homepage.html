                    At Hobbysite, we are a team of developers who who also share a wide range of personal hobbies and creative interests, 
                    so we understand the value of having a dedicated space to express and grow those passions. 
                    This eventually inspired us to create a platform where individuals can showcase their arts and crafts, original works, analysis, discussions, and create a community that helps each other foster their hobbies.  
                    Our goal is to provide specific applications that can support our community and their needs, such as a merchandise store, wiki,  blog, forum, and a commission board.
                    After continuing on developing this platform, we decided to expand this website to include user inputs and functionalities to expand our user base.
